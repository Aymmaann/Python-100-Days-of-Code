# Caesar Cipher

## Overview

This Python script implements the Caesar Cipher, a basic encryption and decryption technique. The user can input a message, choose whether to encrypt or decrypt, specify the shift value, and receive the result.

## Usage

 1. Run the script in a Python environment.

 2. Follow the on-screen prompts:
   - Choose 'encode' to encrypt or 'decode' to decrypt.
   - Enter the message you want to process.
   - Specify the shift value (an integer between 1 and 25).
   - Decide whether to continue with another operation.

## Features

- Supports both encryption and decryption.
- Handles wrapping around the alphabet for shifts that exceed 'z' or go below 'a'.
- Provides a user-friendly interface with input validation.

## Example

```bash
$ python caesar_cipher.py
```

## Have Fun!
Enjoy playing the Caesar Cipher Game! Feel free to modify the code or add your own twist to the caesar function for a personalized experience.
