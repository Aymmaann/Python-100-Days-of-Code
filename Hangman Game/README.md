# Hangman Game
Welcome to the Hangman Game! This simple Python program allows you to play the classic Hangman word-guessing game.

## How to Play
1. Run the program in a Python environment.
2. The program will randomly select a word from a predefined list.
3. You have 7 lives to guess the word.
4. Guess a letter by entering it when prompted.
5. If the letter is correct, it will be revealed in the word.
6. If the letter is incorrect, you will lose a life, and a part of the hangman will be drawn.
7. Continue guessing letters until you either guess the word or run out of lives.

## Hangman ASCII Art
The hangman ASCII art is displayed for each incorrect guess. The hangman will be drawn step by step, and you have to guess the word before the hangman is fully drawn.
