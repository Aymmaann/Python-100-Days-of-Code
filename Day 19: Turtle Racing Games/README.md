# Turtle Racing Games

## Introduction

This project consists of two fun turtle racing games built with Python's Turtle graphics library. The games involve turtles racing along a path, and you can choose your favorite color to participate in the excitement.

### Game 1: Two Turtles Racing Along a Path

In this game, two turtles race along a path with twists and turns. You can choose either the red or blue turtle to compete in the race. The turtles will navigate through the path, and the first turtle to reach the finish line is declared the winner.

### Game 2: Seven Turtles Racing in a Straight Line

In the second game, seven turtles race in a straight line. You can choose a color, and the turtles will move forward randomly. The first turtle to reach the end of the screen will be the winner.

## Instructions

1. Run the Python scripts using a Python interpreter.
2. Follow the on-screen prompts to input your preferences.
3. Enjoy the turtle races and see if your chosen turtle emerges victorious!

## How to Run

Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the Python scripts. Run the scripts with the following commands:

```bash
python two_turtle.py
```
```bash
python turtle_drag_race.py
```

## Customize the Games
Feel free to modify the games or experiment with different settings. You can adjust the number of turtles, colors, or racing conditions to suit your preferences.
